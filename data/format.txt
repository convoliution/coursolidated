		FirstName is a string.
		LastName is a string.
		Majors is a list of strings.
		Minors is a list of strings.
		College is a string.

		Schedule is a list of dictionaries, with the following fields:
			name
			years

			Name is a string (eg. My Schedule).
			Years is a list of dictionaries, each with the following fields:
				name
				terms

				Name is a string (eg. Year 1).
				Terms is a list of dictionaries, each with the following fields:
					id
					courses

					Id is a string (one of: "f", "w", "s", "s1", "s2")
					Courses is a list of strings



Majors:

{
	"MajorCode": {
		"name": "",
		"requirements": [0,
			[0, ""],
			[0, ""],
			. . .
		]
	}
}

Majors is a dictionary where the keys are all the major codes (eg. CG25).

	Each major is a dictionary, with the following fields:

		Name is a string with the name of the major.
		Requirements is a list:
			The first item in the list is a number. This is the number of items in that list that must be chosen to satisfy the requirements.
			A 0 denotes that all items in the list must be met.
			The rest of the list consists of strings representing classes, or of lists representing a choice between two or more classes.
			(eg. [0, [1, "CourseA", "CourseB"], [1, "CourseC", "CourseD"]]
			 denotes that the user must choose 1 course out of A or B, and 1 course out of C or D)



Minors:

{
	"MinorCode": {
		"name": "",
		"requirements": [0,
			[0, ""],
			[0, ""],
			. . .
		]
	}
}

Minors work the same way majors do.



Colleges:

{
	"CollegeName": {
		"requirements": [0,
			[0, ""],
			[0, ""],
			. . .
		]
	}
}

Colleges work the same way majors and minors do, just without a "name" field.



Courses:

{
	"CourseCode": {
		"name": "",
		"department": "",
		"code": "",
		"units": 0,
		"division": 0,
		"consent": [upperDiv, canConsent, mustConsent, department],
		"requirements": [0, ""],
		"crosslist": [[]],
		"offered": [""]
	}
}

Courses is a dictionary where the keys are all of the course codes.

	Each of these keys corresponds to a dictionary with the following fields:
		name
		department
		code
		units
		division
		consent
		requirements
		crosslist
		offered

		Name is the name of the course.
		Department is the letter part of the course code (eg. COGS, from COGS 1).
		Code is the number part of the course code (eg. 6A, from CHEM 6A).
		Division is 0 if the course is lower division, 1 if the course is upper division.
		Units is the number of units that the student will receive upon completion of this course.
		Consent is a four-member list of 1's and 0's:
			The first digit in the list is 1 if upper division status is required for this course, and 0 otherwise.

			The third digit in the list is a 1 if the course requires instructor consent, and 0 otherwise.
			The fourth digit in the list is a 1 if the course requires department consent, and 0 otherwise.
		Requirements is a list of prerequisites, formatted in the same way requirements have been formatted above.
		Crosslist is a list of lists
			Each item in the list is a two-member list.
				The first item in this two-member list is the name of a course which is cross-listed with this course.
				The second item in this two-member list is the number of units the student will receive if they take the cross-listed course after this course.
		Offered is a list of strings, where each string corresponds to a quarter:
			"f" is Fall
			"w" is Winter
			"s" is Spring
